# virtual_hand_mouse-
I am using computer vision for hand recognition then adding functionality to it by making it work as a mouse 

it works as follows it detects the parts of the hand 
and when:
<ul>
  <li>both index and middle finger are straight and the thumb is bent the mose moves </li>
  <li>when we bent the index this symbolizes a left click </li>
  <li>when we bent the middle finger this symbolizes a right click </li>
  <li>if both index and middle fingers are bent this symbolizes a double click </li>
</ul>
